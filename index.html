<p>We will go over a few questions first.<p>
<br>
<h1>Why is this website awesome?</h1>
<p>Because it's a website.</p>
<br>
<h1>What is this website for?</h1>
<p>I dunno.</p>

<h1>Why is the cart not moving Mentlegen?</h1>
<P>You might think that's a joke, you might think it's kinda funny.</p>
<p>And to that I'd say you're an insensitive doodoo willy.</p>
<br>
<h1>So why is this as popular as it is right now at this moment in time?</h1>
<p>Well I'd say your stupid for that, because for 1, its not popular, and 2, well its just a stupid question</p>
<p>To be quite frank with you, I think that's probably why the world's economy is how it is right now... Cause of you</p>
<br>
<p>So, all of the proceeds from this website will be going straight to a fund</p>
<p>that helps people, at least one person, that person being me, and that is going to go straight into my bank account.</p>
<p>That will give me peace of mind, it would give me a Mcflurry from Taco Bell.</p>
<p>That's why we have our little coping mezani- mezakanizums. For me, I have my comfort toy here. *tropical music plays*</p>
<br>
<h2>Now, I would put a few images here, but I don't really have any good ones at the moment...</h2>
<h4>So, go ahead and look at these blank walls, and imagine you are looking at Picaso, or the Mona Lisa.</h4>
<h3>Kandinsky? Can-do-ski! Cezanne's in season. That Seurat would look great on that wall!<h3>
